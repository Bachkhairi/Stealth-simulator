# Stealth Mission Simulator

A reinforcement learning environment where an agent navigates a grid to reach a goal while avoiding patrolling enemies.  
This project uses **Three.js** for rendering and **Q-learning** for the agent's decision-making.

## Features

- **15x17 Grid Environment**: Includes walls, cover, a start point (S), and a goal (G).
- **Reinforcement Learning Agent**: Learns optimal paths using Q-learning while avoiding enemies.
- **Dynamic Enemies**: 5 enemies with 4-step back-and-forth patrol patterns.
- **Reward System**: Balanced rewards and penalties for progress, safety, and efficiency.
- **Visualization**: Real-time 3D rendering using Three.js.

## Usage

- **Start / Pause**: Click **Start** to begin the simulation, and **Pause** to stop it.
- **Reset**: Click **Reset** to reposition the agent at the Start (S).
- **Simulation Speed**: Adjust with the slider (100ms to 2000ms per step).
- **Q-Learning Parameters**: Modify learning rate, discount factor, and epsilon via UI sliders.
- **Export Metrics**: Save simulation metrics by clicking **Export Metrics as CSV**.
- **Line of Sight**: Toggle enemy LOS display: `radius`, `line`, or `none`.

## Configuration

- **Grid**:
  - Size: 15x17
  - Symbols:
    - `W`: Wall
    - `C`: Cover
    - `S`: Start
    - `G`: Goal

- **Enemies**:
  - Count: 5
  - Patrol: 4-step loops
  - Detection: Adjustable LOS radius

- **Q-Learning**:
  - Set in `GridWorld.js`
  - Default parameters:
    ```javascript
    alpha: 0.5
    epsilon: 0.5
    gamma: 0.9
    ```

## Tweakable Parameters

All parameters below are adjustable and influence how the RL agent behaves and learns. You can tweak these in the UI or code to experiment with different strategies:

| Parameter           | Description                                                                 |
|---------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `alpha (Î±)`         | Learning rate (e.g., 0.5) â€“ how quickly the agent updates Q-values          |
| `gamma (Î³)`         | Discount factor (e.g., 0.8) â€“ weights future rewards over immediate ones     |
| `epsilon (Îµ)`       | Exploration rate (e.g., 0.5) â€“ balance between exploring vs exploiting       |
| `epsilonDecay`      | Decay rate (e.g., 0.999) â€“ gradually reduces Îµ to favor learning over time   |
| `minEpsilon`        | Minimum Îµ (e.g., 0.01) â€“ ensures some randomness always remains              |
| `timePenalty`       | Penalty per step (e.g., -0.1) â€“ encourages efficiency                        |
| `forwardReward`     | Reward for progress toward goal (e.g., 1) â€“ motivates forward movement       |
| `detectionPenalty`  | Penalty for enemy detection (e.g., -10) â€“ discourages unsafe actions         |
| `enemyRadius`       | Enemy vision range (e.g., 1.5 tiles) â€“ affects difficulty of stealth         |
| `stealthReward`     | Reward for using cover (e.g., 0.1) â€“ promotes strategic hiding               |
| `coverStreakBonus`  | Bonus for consecutive cover use (e.g., 0.1) â€“ reinforces stealth behavior    |

These allow you to strike a balance between aggressive, stealthy, or safe navigation behaviors.

## Development

- **Tech Stack**:
  - [Three.js](https://threejs.org/) â€” 3D rendering
  - [TWEEN.js](https://github.com/tweenjs/tween.js) â€” smooth animations
  - [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/) â€” UI styling via CDN

- **Enhancements** (optional goals):
  - Improve RL agent
  - Visualize value functions or Q-tables
  - Add Chart.js for real-time metric plotting

- **Debugging**:
  - Use `Logger.js` for structured logging
  - Monitor the browser developer console for warnings/errors
